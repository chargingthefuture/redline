/* Service worker for Redline.
 *
 * Strategy: network-first. When you are online, every file is fetched fresh so
 * you always get the latest game — no hard refresh needed (mobile browsers make
 * that hard anyway). When you are offline, or the network is slow, it falls back
 * to the copy saved in the cache, so "add to home screen" still plays with no
 * connection. Each successful online fetch also refreshes the saved copy.
 *
 * When you add or rename a file the game loads, add it to FILES below so the very
 * first offline visit has it cached. Bumping CACHE_VERSION clears the old cache.
